Hi there ðŸ‘‹, 
Hi Iâ€™m Michael. I write software in Go and JS. 

I currently work as a Junior Software Developer at @Blulog!

How to reach me: wlodarski.michal@pm.me

Fun fact: 

I really like long, exhausing walks in wild. 

I lived abroad for 8 years. 

After 5th coffee I see world in slow-mo.

Have a nice day!
